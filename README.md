# PHP Boilerplate

A boilerplate for new composer based PHP projects.

## Getting started

### Create a new project based on the boilerplate:

```bash
$ composer create-project kreait/php-boilerplate new-project
```

### Update `composer.json`

Replace the Namespaces in the `autoload` and `autoload-dev` sections with your project's namespaces.

### (Optional) Update `.gitattributes`

Remove the comments in `.gitattributes` so that unneeded files for your package won't get included in your releases.

### Start coding! :smile:
